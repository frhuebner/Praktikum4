We were able to create a MOT. Unfortunately it was not very stable because the locking of the laser didn't work properly. Using this we were able measure several dependencies of the florescence, e.g. from the quarter waveplates or the magnetic field and we discussed these dependencies. However since our MOT was not stable we needed to redo our MOT every time. Redoing the MOT under equal conditions yields to wide range of values for the florescence.
