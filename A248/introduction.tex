In atomic physics the magneto-optic trap (MOT) is used to slow down and trap atoms. This is done by a combintation of lasers slowing the atoms down and an additional inhomogeneous magnetic field making the radiation force of the lasers position dependent. In this experiment a MOT is adjusted and used to trap rubidium atoms. The setup of the MOT is optimized by measuring the intensity of the fluorescence from the trapped atoms. The influence of different parameters, e.g.\ the magnetic field strength, on the amount of trapped atoms is measured and evaluated in this report.
