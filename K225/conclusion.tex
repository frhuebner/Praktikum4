In this experiment a fast-slow-coincidence circuit was set up to measure the lifetime spectrum of postrons in indium. During the adjustments the energy spectra of the LYSO scintillator and that of $^{22}$Na were measured. To find the relationship between the bins of the MCA and the real absolut time a prompt curve was measured. \\

In the final measurement lifetime spectra for different temperatures werde measured. To plan the heating a heat curve was recorded. We were able to fit a suitable function to the lifetime spectra. However the determined lifetimes did not show a sensible dependence on the temperature. As a result the vacancy concentration also did not show an exponential dependence on the temperature. Despite of this when fitting an exponential dependence to the data the value for the vacancy formation enthalpy $H_t = (4 \pm 22) \cdot 10^{-3}\,\si{eV}$ differs by two orders of magnitude from the value in \cite{weiler}. As we cand find an error in the evaluation and the recorded spectra we believe that the error lies in the experimental setup. We can not make this more precise.
