In this experiment the time spectrum of positrons decaying in Indium at different temperatures was observed. Therefore we set up a slow and a fast circuit to measure decay times. To actually measure times a time calibration measurement was executed.

We were able to fit a suitable function into the spectra. However the determined decay times did not show a sensible dependence on the temperature. So the vacancy concentration also did not show an exponential dependence on the temperature. Despite of this when fitting a exponential dependence to the data the value for the vacancy formation enthalpy $H_t = (4 \pm 22) \cdot 10^{-3}\,\si{eV}$ differs by two orders of magnitude from the value in \cite{enthalpy}.
