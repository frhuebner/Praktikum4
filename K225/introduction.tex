The aim of this experiment is to examine the behaviour of positrons in metals, i.e.\ in indium. The $\beta^+$-decay of $^{22}$Na is used as the source for positrons which then thermalize in the indium probe. With the measurement of the finite lifetime of the positrons for different temperatures we find the temperature dependence of the vacancy formation enthalpy of indium. For the lifetime measurement a fast-slow-coincidence circuit is used.
